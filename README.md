 ## User-Centric Features:

    Secure User Authentication: Users can effortlessly create and manage their accounts, utilizing their email and password for a secure login process.

    Enhanced Profile Management: Empowering users to stay in control, PHP Motors enables the modification of critical profile elements such as passwords, first and last names, and email addresses.

    Interactive Car Reviews: Your opinions matter. Users have the ability to provide valuable feedback by adding insightful reviews for the vehicles on display.

 ## Admin Empowerment:

    Streamlined Vehicle Addition: The administrative user takes the driver's seat by seamlessly integrating new vehicles into the inventory, ensuring that the selections remain fresh and captivating.

    Admins are equipped to introduce new classifications, enriching the user experience with categories such as Classic, Sports, SUVs, Trucks, and Used.

 ## Modern Development Environment:
 
* The project connections in web sites use a PHP Data Object (PDO) to connect to the database server and interact with those databases stored on the server.

* I created a local environment using server software on my own machine, XAMPP (Apache, MySQL and PHP). (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

* The project uses SQL statements for Selecting, Inserting, Updating and Deleting data from database table. Using PHPMyAdmin to Write and Test Queries.

* HTML5 semantic structures.

* Responsive to varying screen sizes of a variety of devices.

* Modularization for common content (Created a folder in which to store the common code snippets).
